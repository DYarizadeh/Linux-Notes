fdisk -l to find the partitions 
for more information on a specific block device, do fdisk -l (block device) e.g. fdisk -l /sda

The lsblk command lists all block devices and their sizes, including partitions. To see the size of, for example sda3, you can use:
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE

The df command shows the disk space usage of file systems. If sda3 is mounted, you can see its size and how much space is used and available:
df -h

The parted command can also show you the size of partitions with more detail:
sudo parted /dev/sda print

For a quick look at partition sizes and types, including sda3, you can use blkid:
sudo blkid -o list
While blkid is primarily used for showing the UUIDs and types of file systems, when used with -o list, it provides a summary that includes the size of mounted partitions.

/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.: Block device files for hard drives or SSDs. The main drive is typically sda, with partitions numbered like /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, etc.
/dev/hda (historical): Used for IDE devices in older Linux distributions. Similar to /dev/sda but for IDE instead of SATA or SCSI devices.

sudo dd if=/dev/sdy3 of=/path/to/backup_folder/partition3.img bs=4M status=progress conv=sync,noerror

Block Size - 
A commonly recommended starting point is bs=4M or bs=1M, as these sizes often provide a good balance between transfer speed and system load for a variety of devices and use cases.
The default block size if not specified is 512 bytes, which is very small and can result in slower overall performance due to the overhead of handling many small blocks.

SSD vs. HDD: SSDs can generally handle larger block sizes and parallel operations better than HDDs due to their faster read/write speeds and lack of mechanical parts.
Network Storage: When dealing with network storage (e.g., NFS, SMB), the optimal block size might also depend on network bandwidth and latency. Testing with larger block sizes is often beneficial, but very large blocks might lead to issues with network stability or performance.
