Mounting NetScaler (FreeBSD/UFS (unix file system))

Create copies of the VMDK's and copy them to a different folder
Open SIFT VM in VMWare or equivilent
Ls /dev to see what partitions exist (e.g. sda/sdb/sdc) so you can recgonize the before and after
Add the VMDK's as added drives to the VM
Boot VM
Once booted, ls /dev/
The added drives should be /dev/sdb* and /dev/sdc*
In terminal type  "modprobe ufs"
Mount the specific partition holding var
mount -r -t ufs -o ufstype=ufs2 /dev/sdb8 /mnt/p8

The command mount -r -t ufs -o ufstype=ufs2 /dev/sdb8 /mnt/p8 mounts the UFS2 filesystem on /dev/sdb8 at the mount point /mnt/p8. 
The -r option specifies that the filesystem should be mounted read-only. 
The -t option specifies the filesystem type, which in this case is UFS2. 
The -o option specifies additional mount options, in this case the ufstype=ufs2 option, which specifies that the filesystem should be mounted as a UFS2 filesystem.



If given a .aff: 

convert to raw using affuse ( affuse /path/to/image.aff /mnt/aff) 
fdisk -l image.aff.raw
if microsoft - mount -t ntfs-3g -o rw,offset=$((starting offset * 512)) /mnt/aff/image.aff.raw /mnt/mount_point
ls -la /mnt/mount_point


Mounting .img output from DD (e.g. from CP Gateway or if you get "unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'" when trying to mount) 
1. Associate the image with a loop device: This step makes the image accessible as if it were a physical disk.
sudo losetup --find --show yourimage.img

2. Scan the loop device for LVM volumes: This makes the LVM volumes within your image recognizable to the system.
The vgscan command scans all disk devices for LVM volume groups and builds up a cache of LVM metadata found. The vgchange -ay activates all known volume groups.
sudo vgscan
sudo vgchange -ay

3. List the logical volumes: To see the logical volumes available in your image, you can use the lvs command or lvdisplay.
sudo lvdisplay

The following will assume /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 is the LVM on a loop device

4. Create a mount point and mount the logical volume: Once you know the logical volume's path, you can mount it to a directory of your choice.
sudo mkdir /mnt/myimage
sudo mount /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 /mnt/myimage

If you get the error the error "mount: /mnt/ewf: mount(2) system call failed: Structure needs cleaning."
There is a filesystem corruption on the device you're attempting to mount. 
This can happen due to various reasons, such as improper shutdowns, hardware issues, or interrupted write operations. 
To resolve this, you'll need to run a filesystem check and repair operation. 
The specific tool and command you use will depend on the filesystem type of the logical volume you're trying to mount.

If you're unsure of the filesystem, you can simply use fsck directly, and it will attempt to detect the filesystem type and use the appropriate utility:
sudo fsck -y /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00

For XFS, the repair tool is xfs_repair, and you don't need to mount the filesystem to repair it:
sudo xfs_repair /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00

If the filesystem is ext2, ext3, or ext4
sudo fsck.ext4 -y /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00
Replace fsck.ext4 with fsck.ext3 or fsck.ext2 if your filesystem is ext3 or ext2, respectively, and /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 with the path to your logical volume.
