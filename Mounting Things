Mounting NetScaler (FreeBSD/UFS (unix file system))

Create copies of the VMDK's and copy them to a different folder
Open SIFT VM in VMWare or equivilent
Add the VMDK's as added drives to the VM
Boot VM
Once booted, ls /dev/
The added drives should be /dev/sdb* and /dev/sdc*
In terminal type  "modprobe ufs"
Mount the specific partition holding var
mount -r -t ufs -o ufstype=ufs2 /dev/sdb8 /mnt/p8

The command mount -r -t ufs -o ufstype=ufs2 /dev/sdb8 /mnt/p8 mounts the UFS2 filesystem on /dev/sdb8 at the mount point /mnt/p8. 
The -r option specifies that the filesystem should be mounted read-only. 
The -t option specifies the filesystem type, which in this case is UFS2. 
The -o option specifies additional mount options, in this case the ufstype=ufs2 option, which specifies that the filesystem should be mounted as a UFS2 filesystem.
