1. Authentication and Authorization Logs

    /var/log/auth.log (or /var/log/secure on Red Hat-based systems):
        This log tracks all authentication-related activities, including successful and failed login attempts, sudo usage, SSH logins, user creation, and password changes.
        Useful for identifying unauthorized access attempts or compromised user accounts.
        Commands to check:

        bash

        cat /var/log/auth.log
        cat /var/log/secure

2. System Logs

    /var/log/syslog (or /var/log/messages on Red Hat-based systems):
        This is a general-purpose log that records a wide range of system events. It includes kernel messages, hardware issues, startup and shutdown events, and daemon activity.
        It can help in detecting system crashes, reboots, or suspicious activity.
        Commands to check:

        bash

        cat /var/log/syslog
        cat /var/log/messages

3. Kernel Logs

    /var/log/kern.log:
        This log captures messages from the Linux kernel, which can provide insight into hardware failures, driver issues, and kernel-level security events.
        Itâ€™s useful for detecting kernel panics or other critical system issues.
        Command to check:

        bash

        cat /var/log/kern.log

4. Audit Logs

    /var/log/audit/audit.log:
        If the Linux system uses the auditd service, this log contains detailed audit trails, including security events such as file accesses, changes to sensitive files, and administrative actions.
        You can monitor unauthorized access attempts and the modification of system-critical files.
        Command to check:

        bash

        cat /var/log/audit/audit.log

5. Service-Specific Logs

    /var/log/{service_name}.log (e.g., Apache, MySQL, Postfix):
        Many services have their own logs. For example:
            Apache Logs: /var/log/apache2/access.log and /var/log/apache2/error.log (or /var/log/httpd/ on Red Hat).
            MySQL Logs: /var/log/mysql.log or /var/log/mysql/error.log.
            Postfix Logs: /var/log/maillog.
        These logs provide insights into the operation and potential abuse of specific services.

6. User Activity Logs

    ~/.bash_history (or history command):
        This file stores the command history of each user. It can provide information on what commands were executed by a user during a session.
        Command to check:

        bash

    cat ~/.bash_history

/var/log/wtmp and /var/log/lastlog:

    These logs contain information on user login and logout activities.
    wtmp keeps a history of logins, reboots, and system activity, while lastlog tracks the most recent login of each user.
    Commands to check:

    bash

        last
        lastlog

7. SSH Logs

    /var/log/secure (on Red Hat) or /var/log/auth.log (on Debian):
        These logs are particularly useful for tracking SSH login attempts and monitoring failed and successful remote access to the system.
        Look for brute-force attempts, unusual login times, or login attempts from suspicious IP addresses.

8. Cron Logs

    /var/log/cron:
        This log contains entries related to scheduled tasks (cron jobs) and their execution. Suspicious or unauthorized cron jobs could be a sign of compromise.
        Command to check:

        bash

        cat /var/log/cron

9. Dmesg Log

    /var/log/dmesg:
        This log captures kernel ring buffer messages, which can reveal hardware and driver issues, especially during boot time.
        Command to check:

        bash

        dmesg

10. X Session Logs

    ~/.xsession-errors:
        This file logs errors related to the graphical user interface (GUI). It can provide insights into user activity and errors encountered during their session in the GUI environment.
        Command to check:

        bash

        cat ~/.xsession-errors

11. Firewall Logs

    If firewall logging is enabled (e.g., using iptables, ufw, or firewalld), these logs may contain entries showing connections that were blocked or allowed through the firewall.
    Common location:
        /var/log/ufw.log (for UFW)
        /var/log/firewalld (for Firewalld)
