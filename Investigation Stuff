Secure File - file that logs security incidents. 
/var/log/auth.log 
File tracks new user creation, new group creation, logging in from remote system, changing of a user's password. 

Access.log file - keeps track of web server connections (e.g. Apache) 
/var/log/apache2/access.log
Tracks IP address, user agent, Date/Time Stamps

.bash_history - tracks commands typed in bash
/home/user/.bash_history

Linux OS system logs -
/var/log/messages*
 
Linux OS authentication logs -
/var/log/secure* 
/var/run/utmp 
/var/log/wtmp* 
/var/log/btmp*

Depreciated systemd - if exists,systemd can boot executable script. Existance not enough to prove execution. Evidence is in syslog (see grep)
/etc/rc.local
cat /var/log/syslog | egrep "rc-local.service|/etc/rc.local Compatibility"

/etc/init.d - traditional init for linux. Depreciated version of systemd. Can point to malicious executable script. 
/etc/init.d/*
/etc/init/*
/etc/rc.d/*
 
Scheduled tasks -
/etc/crontab
/etc/cron.d/*
/etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}/*
/var/spool/cron/crontab/*
/etc/cron.allow /etc/cron.deny

Systemd (services; also check for .timer) -
/etc/systemd/system/*.service
/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/*.service
/lib/systemd/system/*.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/*.service

There are two lines we want to focus on:
ExecStart: This is the command that is run when the service starts
WantedBy: Having a value of multi-user.target means that the service should start on boot time.

Suspicious indicator for services (errors and output in services wont be logged in syslog) 
StandardOutput=null
StandardError=null

Locations for user defined services (also check for .timer)
/home/user/.config/systemd/user/*.service
/etc/systemd/user/*.service
/home/user/.local/share/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/local/share/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/share/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/local/lib/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/*.service


Authorized SSH Keys - 
The authorized_keys file can be placed in the <home>/.ssh/authorized_keys directory of each user in the machine.

Is SSH enabled?
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

Check to see if a shell is configured on accounts that shouldn't have a shell
/etc/passwd
(no shell) www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin
(yes shell) www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/bin/bash

Account Creation/Manipulation - Check modify time of: 
/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/gshadow and /etc/group

Live forensics - 

rc.local 
Check the status of the rc-local.service and see if it is not incative
$ # systemctl status rc-local
