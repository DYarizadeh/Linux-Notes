Secure File - file that logs security incidents. 
/var/log/auth.log 
File tracks new user creation, new group creation, logging in from remote system, changing of a user's password. 

Access.log file - keeps track of web server connections (e.g. Apache) 
/var/log/apache2/access.log
Tracks IP address, user agent, Date/Time Stamps

.bash_history - tracks commands typed in bash
/home/user/.bash_history

Linux OS system logs -
/var/log/messages*
 
Linux OS authentication logs -
/var/log/secure* 
/var/run/utmp 
/var/log/wtmp* 
/var/log/btmp*
 
Scheduled tasks -
/etc/crontab
/etc/cron.d/*
/etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}/*
/var/spool/cron/crontab/*
/etc/cron.allow /etc/cron.deny

Systemd (services; also check for .timer) -
/etc/systemd/system/*.service
/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/*.service
/lib/systemd/system/*.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/*.service

There are two lines we want to focus on:
ExecStart: This is the command that is run when the service starts
WantedBy: Having a value of multi-user.target means that the service should start on boot time.

Suspicious indicator for services (errors and output in services wont be logged in syslog) 
StandardOutput=null
StandardError=null

Locations for user defined services (also check for .timer)
/home/user/.config/systemd/user/*.service
/etc/systemd/user/*.service
/home/user/.local/share/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/local/share/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/share/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/local/lib/systemd/user/*.service
/usr/lib/systemd/user/*.service
